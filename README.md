## ABOUT
Client-side scripts to play the screeps.com game.

## WHY
These are some **experiments** with using bots in the Screeps.com game.

After searching for 2 nights and finding terrible examples on how to write bots for screeps.com, I've decided to start this project to see if anyone wants to collaborate on it.

>I plan on doing major refactoring over time.  First of all, I don't even really know how to play Screeps as I started 2 nights ago, so I plan to spend some time to see what's involved and grow (april 2021).

Try it out and *tell me* if you like it, or if it helped you improve your game, coding, or logic.

## GOAL
>To learn how the client-side Screeps game works and improve upon programming skills, whether that be javascript, node.js, python, or even markdown language.

>I have been told it's impossible to use a data center to play this game, because of the CPU/Mem constraints.  My initial impression is they are wrong, so I want to see if I can do it, or if it's simply a forced-limitation on the game.
